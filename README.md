# DDoS attack Detection using Deep Neural Network Approches

We proposed Deep Convolutional Neural Network Bi Long-Short Term Memory (DCNNBiLSTM) and Deep Convolutional Neural Network Gated Recurring Unit (DCNNGRU) to detect DDoS attacks.

The paper has been accepted in 8th International Conference for Convergence in Technology (I2CT), and is available at IEEEXplore.
