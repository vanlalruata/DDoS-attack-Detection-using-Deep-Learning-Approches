# DDoS attack Detection using Deep Neural Network Approches

We proposed Deep Convolutional Neural Network Bi Long-Short Term Memory (DCNNBiLSTM) and Deep Convolutional Neural Network Gated Recurring Unit (DCNNGRU) to detect DDoS attacks.

# Abstract:
In this study, we provide Deep Neural Network (DNN) based approaches to detecting Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. In order to improve the DNNâ€™s accuracy, the suggested approaches use two different hybrid DNN scenario detections to demonstrate the possibilities. As training and testing data, we use the publicly available Intrusion Detection datasets; CIC-IDS2017 and CIC-DDoS2019. Experiments have shown that the presented approaches are 99.9% effective at detecting attacks.
